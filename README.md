# ML_DATA_PROJECT
This project aims to predict the solubility (logS) of compounds using two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The dataset used is the Delaney solubility dataset with molecular descriptors.
Dataset

The dataset is sourced from a CSV file available at:
Delaney Solubility Dataset

The dataset contains molecular descriptors and the solubility values (logS) for various compounds.
Requirements

    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    numpy

You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
Running the Code

To execute the code, simply run the Python script containing the above code snippets. Ensure all required packages are installed and the internet connection is available to fetch the dataset.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models to predict the solubility of compounds. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (r2).

Feel free to modify and extend this project to explore other machine learning models or datasets.
